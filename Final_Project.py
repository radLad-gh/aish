            The tables are laden with the most succulent fruits, meats, and candies. The weary travelers lay waste to 
            the meal, ravenously tearing apart the display, knowing this might be their last meal. So concerned with the 
            food, they don't see the guards at all entrances. How peculiar, that the guards are on the inside of the 
            doors. Shouldn't guards be posted to stop people from coming in, you wonder? 
            
            You realize that this is not a welcoming party, but a fattening routine. 
            
            You and yours are being prepared like foie gras farms as tribute to the Minotaur, filling your stomachs 
            to transfer these delicious foods to the Beast of the Labyrinth. With this morbid realization at the 
            forefront of your mind, you eat in moderation, tempering your hunger with the gravity of the task ahead. 
            
            As you gaze around, a woman on the second floor catches your eye, staring intently at you while you eat. 
            A bit unnerving, but you HAVE all been reduced to fodder for the slaughterhouse. When you meet her gaze, 
            she holds it for a few seconds, then walks away. Shortly after the exchange, when more food is brought 
            out, one of the serving staff slips you a small bag and whispers, "Hide this, it's from her Highness." 
            You feel some sort of ball within, firm but yielding.

            You are the child of the great King Aegeus. 
            
            You have volunteered to end the culling of your brethren. As divine punishment for killing a Cretan decades 
            ago, every nine years, seven Athenian boys and seven Athenian girls are taken as tribute and left to die as 
            feed for the great beast of the Labyrinth, the Minotaur. 
            
            As you stand at the entrance of the Maze, smooth stone walls rising up 40 feet on each side, you worry about 
            being unable to find your way through. You happen to spot a worn post by the entrance to the maze and 
            wonder what its use could be. It strikes you that perhaps you can use the clew of yarn in your bag. 
            You take it out and pull on it, testing its strength. Though it stretches a bit, it doesn't break, even
            with a mighty pull. You tie one end of the clew to the post, unraveling it as you and the other Athenians 
            start your way through the maze. 
            
            The stone walls hold no warmth, and as night falls, neither do you. You fear sleep, as you are certain
            it will lead to your demise by some creature of the Labyrinth. It was never mentioned in the myths that
            many monsters would come to call the Labyrinth home, wandering into it and remaining trapped or seeking it 
            out in the hopes of partaking in some of the tribute that would wander in periodically. Oh, and they would 
            eat each other. Times are tough, ya know? 
            
            You know that you have to move quickly so as to take advantage of the food, or else your strength will fail
            you before you reach the Minotaur. So you pick up your pace, albeit as quietly as possible, hoping the 
            mysterious woman's string can give you a way back. 
            
            After moving through the labyrinth for what felt like hours, you come upon a door, the first you've seen,
            with gold leaf inlaid in its surface. It is strange in its composition, being both very rugged in 
            construction yet gaudy in decoration.

            You staggered into this open room, tired and seeing nothing but the turns, left, right, left, right, 
            spinning through your weary mind. You've tied off to the post, closed the door behind you and now, leaning
            on that same door on whose sturdy construction you now rely to give you the rest you need, you sleep. You 
            have determined that will the grate locked, and you leaning on the entrance to the maze, you have time to 
            recuperate some of the energy you lost, partly through the emotional toll but mostly from the physical toll 
            of traversing the maze.

            You wake up stiff, your sleep having been full of the things you hoped to escape for but a few minutes.
            Beast-men of lore, monsters you'd only heard told in stories to scare children, now they returned to 
            frighten you in your most helpless, vulnerable time, sleep. As you stretch and shake off the last wisps of
            dreams that cling to your mind, your gaze sharpens, returning to your task. You look around the room, 
            seeking progress, and your eyes fall upon a door across the grate. You approach the door, knowing that your
            path leads through it.

        "spiderroom":

            Reaching out for the handle, you notice it. There is a fine web that sits on every square inch 
            of the heavy wooden door. Almost like something out of a fairy tale, the closer you look, the 
            more you discover. When you lift the handle, spiders scurry out from beneath their makeshift cover.
            As the door opens, a scene unlike any you have ever faced sits in front of you. 
            
            What appears to be an enormous dining hall, fit for kings and queens, lies...mostly, unoccupied 
            but clothed from arch to flagstone in dozen of different types of webs. Funnels, nets, balls. 
            And on this thick fog of silk, the thousands of spiders that called that agglomeration of web home. 
            
            There was, however, one problem. Other than the spiders. There was, on the other side of the dining 
            hall, through all the webs, through all the spiders, and all those legs, a door.
            
            A door, with a bright, shiny, untouched door handle. Glinting, almost teasing, from the other side 
            of the room. You know you'll never get through there in one piece or unbitten. There MUST be something
            you can use or have to keep the spiders at bay. But what?

            At first you are simply intrigued by this technology. You marvel at the craftsmanship, having thought it 
            impossible, or at least unheard of to create mirrors of this size. Upon examination of the mirrors, however,
            a small feeling of something being slightly off arises in the pit of your stomach. 
            
            The bare stone ceiling and floor yield no further clues so you are certain that the answer lies in these 
            gods-forsaken mirrors. You walk back and forth in front of them, seeking even the slightest information, 
            when you notice something on a mirror across the room. The trim on the sandals of the Theseus in the mirror 
            across the room is blue, while your own have a red trim. You only notice because these are your lucky 
            sandals, given to you on your 18th birthday when you also received your sword. You examine the mirror, 
            noting that nothing else seems to be out of place, then turn to the mirror next to it, looking for 
            something, anything. On that mirror, you notice that THAT version of you has a different sword at his side. 
            You know not what magic is on these mirrors, for they are not static, just different versions. The version
            of you in the mirror mimics your every move, with slight changes in each as far as clothes, mannerism, 
            aesthetic. 
            
            You step back now, hoping to gain some greater knowledge about the mirrors. At this point, however, your 
            mind has fixated on finding the flaws in reflection. The next mirror you lay eyes on, however, doesn't seem 
            to have one. You pore over it, looking for any tiny difference, but find none. Considering the nature of the
            room, you are sure that either you are missing the fault in the image or there is none. But, tired of the 
            games, you choose to destroy that mirror, hoping to reveal something more. 
            
            You crack the pommel of your sword on the surface of the mirror, causing the shards to fall and reveal a
            door. The door is small, creating an opening only large enough for one person to sidle in sideways. 
            ''',
        "keyroom":

            Knowing that there must be a way to find the right key, you persist in combing through the piles and
            piles of keys. There seems to be no difference to any of them, really, as far as uniqueness. They're just...
            plain old keys. Your eyes are swimming with keys, they're just blending together at this point. You've 
            looked in drawers, on hooks, under papers, underfoot, overhead, and nothing. You looked for a way out but 
            the only way in or out of this room appears to be the way you came in, through the mirror hall. As your hand
            passes over what feels like the millionth key, you see it. 
            
            A sun. 
            
            You fly toward it, not wanting to lose sight of it among the other nondescript keys around it. You're not 
            even sure how you were able to spot it but the key has a tiny sun engraved on the head. Almost scratched on,
            it appears to be fresh, as you can clearly distinguish the shiny metal from the scratched sun as newer than 
            the age of the surrounding unscratched metal. You are sure this is the key. Now, to use it on the right 
            lock. 
            
                Where to now, champion?

            Taking a look around the room in what little light you have, you see this place almost as a cell. It is 
            cold, damp, simply a stone box with one way in and one way out. In fact, it seems almost reminiscent of the
            dungeons you heard of that are used in France called oubliettes. In these dungeons, there is a steep slope 
            down to a hole that connects the dungeon cell to the outside, creating a simple yet inescapable prison.
            
            As you stand there, in the flickering light of the torch, you wonder how you came to this moment. This 
            beast, how did he come to be here? 
                What is his story? 
                    Is this true Justice?

            You don't know the answers to these and other questions but for the moment, you know that  your people are 
            dying and that the Minotaur will surely kill you upon waking. With those two thoughts in mind, you know that

            With the body of a man and the head of a bull, he is a massive, hulking representation of both.
            Standing well over seven feet tall and composed of pure muscle, skin covered in what you assume
